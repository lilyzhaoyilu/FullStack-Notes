# Document Object Model

### Document

The **Document** is any web page loaded in by the browser.

It serves as an entry point into the web page's content.

### Document Object Model\(DOM\)

DOM is an API provided by the browser in which JavaScript code can be used to access the HTML content of a page. 

DOM is an interface that allows us to break down a web page into a hierarchy of nodes, and manipulate those nodes with JavaScript. 

The ability to manipulate the DOM is one of the most unique and useful abilities of JavaScript.

an HTML page on its own is not made up of underlying data structures, and that it is the **DOM itself that is translating the HTML into a node tree**. Without the DOM, we wouldn't have any way to manipulate the document and its component parts using JavaScript code alone.



We can use DOM to both \(1\) modify the content of the web page from JavaScript and \(2\) ask the browser to call our JavaScript code when events occur. This is the foundation of all interactive browser web applications.



However, even though the DOM is standardized by the W3C, it is not implemented identically across browsers. Some browsers support some parts of the DOM, but not others. The same methods sometimes do slightly different things. This is worst in old versions of IE, which did not try very hard to be faithful to specifications.
